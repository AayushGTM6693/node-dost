-  MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it stores data in a non-relational format (documents).
-  Data is stored in BSON format (Binary JSON), allowing for nested and complex data structures.
-  MongoDB doesn't enforce a schema, making it flexible and allowing dynamic data structures.

 - A record in MongoDB, represented as a JSON object (BSON in storage).
-  A key-value pair in a document, similar to a column in SQL.

CRUD Operations

Create: Use insertOne() or insertMany() to add documents.
Read: Use find() to query documents, with optional filters to refine results.
Update: Use updateOne() or updateMany() to modify existing documents.
Delete: Use deleteOne() or deleteMany() to remove documents.

Querying

Basic Query: { field: value } - retrieves documents where the field matches the value.
Operators: Use operators like $gt, $lt, $in, etc., to refine queries.
Projections: Select specific fields to return in a query using { field: 1, _id: 0 }.
