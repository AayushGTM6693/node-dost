- In Node there are certain objects called event emitter that emits named event.
These events are picked up by event listeners and callback func attached to them gets fired

for eg =>  server.emit("request");
           server.on("request",(req,res)=>{}) // server is the instance of node js Event emitter class
           
- Event emitter logic  = Observer pattern
