- node js = v8 engine(c++) +  libuv(c++) 
- v8 converts the js code into machine code 
- libuv is a open source library strong foucs
on async io. This layer gives node access to underlying
computer OS, file, networking etc.

- libuv contains event loop and thread pool

- event loop => it handles easy tasks (executing callbacks)
- thread pool => it handles heavy tasks (file access, compression)
- node => event driven architecture - event emit => event loops picks => callback are called
- node also rely on http-parser, c-ares(DNS), openSSL(cryptography), zlib(compression)
